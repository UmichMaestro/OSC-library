Setting Up OSC Pack Library
----------------------------

1. Download OSCpack library from Github

2. Open Visual Studio and in the Solution Explorer select the BodyBasics-D2D, or whereever we name the main CPP file. 
	Open Properties --> You can do this by clicking on the wrench shortcut, hitting Alt-Enter, or going to Project > Properties
 
3. Go to Configuration Properties > VC++ Directories
	Under Include Directories, you should include the location of each of the OSCpack folders
	i.e. Filepath\oscpack_1_1_0\tests ; oscpack_1_1_0\osc ; oscpack_1_1_0 ip ; etc. 

4. Download the OSClib project & solution from Github. Complete step 3 with the OSClib project file. 

5. Go back to the main project/CPP file (BodyBasics-D2D) and go to File > Add > Existing Project
	We're going to add in the OSClib static library that we just built. VS references the project
	If done successfully, you should see it in your solution explorer sidebar
	If you get a lot of errors or can't include the project, refer to step 9 onward. 

6. Under Properties > Common Properties > References you should now add the OSClib project as a reference
	Just hit Add New Reference... and follow those steps.

7. Go to Properties > Configuration Properties > Linker > Input
	You should have all of the following libraries included. I can't remember which ones are automatically included/inherited, so just double check this liss
		kinect20.lib
		kernel32.lib
		user32.lib
		gdi32.lib
		winspool.lib
		comdlg32.lib
		advapi32.lib
		shell32.lib
		ole32.lib
		oleaut32.lib
		uuid.lib
		odbc32.lib
		odbccp32.lib
		winmm.lib

8. Run the program. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. If the OSClib project solution doesn't work, do the following:

10. Under Properties > Configuration Properties > Librarian > Additional Dependencies it should say ws2_32.lib. If it doesn't, include it now. 

11. Build the solution. There might be warnings, but there shouldn't be any errors and it should build successfully. We can deal with the warnings later. 

12. Go back to step 5. 

I may have forgotten a detail or two, so just let me know if the above doesn't work.
